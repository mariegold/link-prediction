# Drug Interactions Prediction

##### EE-452 Network Machine Learning (Spring 2022): Final project

*Authors: Marie Biolková, Jiří Lhotka*

In this project, we investigate the [ogbl-ddi](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/linkprop/#ogbl-ddi) dataset using network science and establish a baseline on link prediction using a graph convolutional network (GCN). We achieve **62.9% Hits@20** on the test data.

You can read our [report](report.pdf). [Here](https://mariegold.github.io/link-prediction/index.html) is a sub-sampled visualization of the graph.
